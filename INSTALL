Admes Installation Guide.


-= R E Q U I R E D =-


Regardless of the system used, you have to had some
applications and libraries pre-installed (pre-compiled).

Linux easy-to-go installation scripts in the end.

--- Qt ---

Qt is framework, which is basis for 'admes'.
Qt5 is required!
In Linux, you have two ways:
first, you can download Qt Framework from
official site;
second, you can use 'apt' or another package manager
to install Qt;
All you need is libqt5core5a, libqt5network5, qt5-qmake, 
qt5-qmake-bin, qt5-qmake, qt5-default:

    $ sudo apt install libqt5core5a libqt5network5 qt5-qmake \
    qt5-qmake-bin qt5-qmake qt5-default

In Windows you have to download Qt Framework
from official site.

--- TOR ---

TOR is used to connect through NAT.
In Linux, you can use 'apt' or another package manager
to install 'tor':

    $ sudo apt install tor

On Windows you must use TOR Expert Bundle, which can be
downloaded using the following link:
https://www.torproject.org/download/tor/

--- GMP ---

GMP provides capability to work with long numbers.
Building with GMP is available only in Linux.
In Windows, please, use MPIR.
You can use 'apt' or another package manager to
install GMP:

    $ sudo apt install libgmp-dev

--- MPIR ---

(!) See MPIR documentation for details.
MPIR can be used instead of GMP, but it is more challenging to
compile and install. On the other hand, it works faster!
MPIR provides capability to work with long numbers. It is
required for such asymmetric cryptography algorithms as
encryption and digital signature algorithms based on
elliptic curve cryptography.

You have to download it from official site (version 3.0.0):
http://mpir.org/downloads.html
This website also presents great documentation for MPIR.

In Linux you have to had pre-installed 'm4' and 'yasm' to
compile MPIR .Usually, both of these can be found using 'apt' 
or another package manager, but sometimes it cannot find 'yasm', 
then you have to compile (and install) it from sources, which can 
be downloaded from https://yasm.tortall.net/Download.html.
Then:

    $ cd path/to/mpir3.0.0
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

(!) If you have no 'configure' file, please, see MPIR's installation guide.
You have to configure qmake to use admes with MPIR instead of GMP.
When you build admes, enter:

    qmake CONFIG+=MPIR_H ../admes.pro

In Windows you also have to compile MPIR. First, you have to
download 'yasm' (see link above). There are pre-compiled
binaries for both Win64 and Win32, but admes was configured to
be compiled for Win32 (for now). Be careful, you need 'vsyasm.exe', not 
'yasm.exe'. Download and extract all files to 'C:\Program Files\yasm'.
Then, you can use Microsoft Visual Studio to compile MPIR.
You need compile 'mpir.dll', 'mpir.lib', 'mpir.h' (all from 
one project) and put them to 'path\to\admes\libs\mpir'.
There are already the files you need, but since MPIR is 
platform dependent, it may not work on your PC.


-= W I N D O W S =-


Only Windows x86.
To compile admes in Windows totally recommended to use
QtCreator downloaded from official site. If your Qt Kit
was configured correctly, you need only to choose 'release'
and then build this.
After admes was built, you must manually put following dlls
to the admes directory:

from ...\Qt\5.*\mingw*\bin:
    -- Qt5Core.dll
    -- Qt5Network.dll
    -- libwinpthread-1.dll
    -- libstdc++-6.dll
    -- libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
from ...\path\to\admes\libs\mpir:
    -- mpir.dll

In future versions a script for auto compiling will be added.

- (!)PRE-COMPILED BINARIES(!):
Since compiling admes in Windows is quite challenging,
pre-compiled binaries were put into admes\bin.
In most cases, you will be able to use admes\bin\admes.exe.


-= L I N U X =-


Both Linux x86 and x64.
To compile admes in Linux you can use console or QtCreator.

Console: 

    $ cd path/to/admes
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ qmake ../admes.pro
    $ make

QtCreator:
    Configure Qt Kit
    Choose 'release'
    build


-= EASY-TO-GO =-


Firstly, got to admes directory.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install libqt5core5a libqt5network5 qt5-qmake \
qt5-qmake-bin qt5-qmake qt5-default libgmp-dev tor torsocks
mkdir build && cd build
qmake ../admes.pro
make

That's it!
